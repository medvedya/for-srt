1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:10,840
The man known to history as George Washington
was born on the 22nd of February 1732 at his

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:17,199
father’s plantation of Pope’s Creek in
Westmoreland County in the Colony of Virginia,

3
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,600
one of the thirteen British colonies in North
America.

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,539
His father was Augustine Washington, a member
of Virginia’s landed gentry, and a successful

5
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:34,059
businessman who owned several tobacco plantations
as well as iron operations in Virginia and

6
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:39,200
neighbouring Maryland in partnership with
the English Principio Company.

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,899
He was also active in the local militia and
was a justice of the peace and sheriff for

8
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:46,399
Westmoreland County.

9
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:53,059
Augustine had married his first wife Jane
Butler in 1715, who bore him four children

10
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:55,880
before her death in 1729.

11
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:03,060
A couple of years later in 1731 he would marry
the 23-year-old Mary Johnson Ball, who would

12
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:08,220
give him a further six children, of whom George
was the eldest.

13
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,610
Mary Washington was born in 1708 to an elderly
father who died three years later, leaving

14
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,850
her 400 acres of land, while her mother died
when she was twelve.

15
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:25,770
The orphaned Mary was left in the care of
family friend George Eskridge, who was probably

16
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,220
responsible for introducing her to Augustine
Washington.

17
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:35,869
Thus, when Mary gave birth to her first son,
she named him George.

18
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:41,040
Brought up as a loyal subject of the British
Empire, as a child George Washington could

19
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,909
never imagine that one day he would be responsible
for leading the successful military rebellion

20
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:51,619
to break free from Britain and establish the
United States of America.

21
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:57,810
He grew up in eastern Virginia amidst a vast
expanse of farmland with plantation houses

22
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,259
and small towns dotted across the landscape.

23
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:07,289
Within the British social hierarchy, the Washingtons
were considered commoners, far removed from

24
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:10,860
the regal splendour of the court of King George
II.

25
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,340
Nevertheless, within the American colonies
the Washingtons were by no means poor, and

26
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:22,450
with over 10,000 acres of plantation land
together with his other commercial interests,

27
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,380
Augustine Washington was certainly a member
of the local elite.

28
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,840
His wealth and prosperity depended in part
on slave labour, allowing plantation owners

29
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:39,739
a lot of free time, which was typically filled
with fox hunts, horse races, and other entertainments.

30
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:44,090
Augustine Washington’s tendency to move
around his properties to better manage his

31
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:48,560
business interests meant that George had an
unsettled childhood.

32
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:56,230
In 1735 the family moved to the 2500-acre
estate of Little Hunting Creek on the banks

33
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:03,290
of the Potomac River, and three years later
in 1738 they moved once again to Ferry Farm

34
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:08,510
on the Rappahannock River across from the
port of Fredericksburg, and a short ride away

35
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,489
from the ironworks at Accokeek Creek.

36
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:16,629
From his house, George could see the ships
being loaded with tobacco, iron, and other

37
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:21,950
commodities which would soon fuel the very
early stages of the Industrial Revolution

38
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:26,819
and in return, the colony of Virginia grew
steadily richer.

39
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:32,430
One of the most important figures in George’s
childhood was his half-brother, Lawrence.

40
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:37,250
Fourteen years older than George, Lawrence
studied at Appleby Grammar School where he

41
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,620
stayed on as a teacher until the age of twenty.

42
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,230
It was around this time, when George was six
years old, that the two brothers first met.

43
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:52,370
He heard stories of Lawrence’s service as
a captain in a Virginia company in 1739 during

44
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:58,200
the War of Jenkin’s Ear against Spain, named
after the British naval captain whose ear

45
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:03,120
had been cut off during an altercation with
the Spanish several years earlier.

46
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,370
Lawrence was part of an expeditionary force
led by Admiral Edward Vernon which attacked

47
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,840
the Spanish port of Cartagena in South America.

48
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,250
The effort proved a bloody failure as the
force was cut down by the enemy and yellow

49
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,340
fever.

50
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:23,540
Captain Washington never made it off the ship,
blaming General Thomas Wentworth, who treated

51
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:28,449
the American soldiers with disdain and did
not even let them leave their ships.

52
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:33,229
In spite of this, Lawrence Washington proudly
served the British army as a commissioned

53
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:38,240
officer and was appointed adjutant general
of Virginia, with responsibility over the

54
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,610
organisation of the colony’s militia companies.

55
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:46,860
When his father transferred him to the management
of the estate at Little Hunting Creek, he

56
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,130
renamed it Mount Vernon after the admiral.

57
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:57,350
George may have expected to receive the same
classical education as his elder half-brothers,

58
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:03,470
but such hopes were extinguished on the 12th
of April 1743, when his father died at the

59
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,090
age of 49.

60
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:10,550
The 11-year-old George’s share of his father’s
inheritance was Ferry Farm, but his mother

61
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:16,580
Mary continued to run the estate and would
continue to do so as George reached adulthood.

62
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:21,980
Mary’s strict upbringing of her five surviving
children meant that the relationship between

63
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:27,759
mother and son was cool and distant, with
George addressing her in formal terms in his

64
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,509
letters as “Honoured Madam.”

65
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:36,900
He looked forward to his trips to visit Lawrence
at Mount Vernon as an escape from his overbearing

66
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,360
mother.

67
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:44,030
Details of George Washington’s early education
are sketchy and any instruction he received

68
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,199
was likely rather basic.

69
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:51,150
The available evidence suggests that he had
lessons in basic mathematics and picked up

70
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:55,050
knowledge of business and economics of his
own accord.

71
00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:00,630
As a teenager he would read widely in history
and philosophy as well as the popular fiction

72
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,800
of the time.

73
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,780
He also enjoyed physical activity and outdoor
pursuits, swimming in the Rappahannock, and

74
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:12,360
proved to be an excellent horseback rider,
an attribute that would serve him well in

75
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,640
his military career.

76
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:19,419
Later in life Washington regretted not having
the opportunity to study French, Latin, and

77
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:23,970
Greek, the signs of social and intellectual
distinction of the day.

78
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:29,360
Among his better educated friends and colleagues
such as John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and

79
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,669
Alexander Hamilton, who provided the theoretical
and intellectual foundations of the United

80
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:39,449
States of America, Washington’s intellect
seemed backward and provincial.

81
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:47,460
In his own terms, however, he was an intelligent
man who could translate ideas into action.

82
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:52,680
After losing his father, Washington came to
rely even more heavily on his brother Lawrence,

83
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,070
who had not only been elected to the House
of Burgesses but had married Ann Fairfax,

84
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:03,220
whose family owned more than five million
acres, managed by her father Colonel William

85
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:08,169
Fairfax on behalf of his English cousin, the
6th Baron Fairfax.

86
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:13,530
The young George Washington befriended Ann’s
brother George William Fairfax who was eight

87
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:18,990
years his senior, and also won the affection
of her father the colonel.

88
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:25,160
In 1746 the elder Fairfax and Lawrence planned
to help George escape the clutches of his

89
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,300
mother by joining the Royal Navy.

90
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:33,910
Unwilling to lose a useful helping hand on
the farm, Mary eventually vetoed the plan.

91
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:39,940
Thwarted in his ambitions to go to sea, at
the age of 15 George decided to become a surveyor,

92
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:44,990
a lucrative profession as settlers continued
to expand westwards.

93
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:51,310
This training allowed him to appreciate geographical
features on maps and in the real world, a

94
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,639
skill which he would use throughout his professional
life.

95
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:01,139
His first job in the spring of 1748 was to
help the Fairfaxes divide up their vast domains

96
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,740
into plots for further development.

97
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:09,129
Within a couple of years he would make his
first investments in land, buying up over

98
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:13,090
2,000 acres by the time he turned twenty.

99
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:19,979
George would add to his land holdings in 1752
following the death of Lawrence from tuberculosis

100
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:25,650
that July at the age of 34, leaving behind
his wife and a baby daughter.

101
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:31,319
Lawrence stipulated that in the event of their
deaths, his estate of Mount Vernon would pass

102
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,529
on to George.

103
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:37,979
The death of his brother dealt a heavy blow
to George, who had hoped to emulate Lawrence’s

104
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:39,450
military career.

105
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:44,360
After lobbying the Lieutenant Governor of
Virginia Robert Dinwiddie, he was appointed

106
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:51,250
adjutant general of his home district in February
1753 with the rank of major.

107
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,740
Major Washington would soon be a very busy
man.

108
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:01,500
By 1753, both the British and French empires
owned large tracts of land in North America.

109
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,830
The thirteen British colonies stretched along
the eastern coast, bounded by the Allegheny

110
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:12,390
Mountains to the west, while the French territories
ran from New Orleans in the southwest through

111
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:17,180
the Mississippi to the Great Lakes and the
Saint Lawrence River in the North.

112
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:23,050
As both empires expanded their footprint,
they soon had competing claims on the vast

113
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,540
Ohio Country.

114
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:30,610
In 1752, the French began building several
forts in the disputed territory, and the following

115
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:37,220
year Lieutenant Governor Dinwiddie, a leading
investor in the Ohio Company, received permission

116
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:42,740
from London to build a set of British forts
alongside instructions to inform the French

117
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,350
to leave the area.

118
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:49,589
The 21-year-old Washington was chosen for
this special mission and set off with a small

119
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:55,220
company and crossed the Alleghenies in November
1753.

120
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:00,410
Washington executed his task diligently, not
only carrying out his diplomatic duties but

121
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:05,460
gathering intelligence on the terrain and
the strength of the French and Native American

122
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,350
presence in the area.

123
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:13,060
Upon his return to the colonial capital of
Williamsburg in January 1754, his journal

124
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:18,680
was adapted into a report for the council
and was passed onto London, where it informed

125
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:25,370
British military preparations to defend the
Ohio Country against the French.

126
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:30,240
Washington secured for himself a major role
in these military preparations, leading a

127
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,480
small militia force who would march to the
Forks of the Ohio River and construct a fort.

128
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,230
At the same time, he was promoted to the rank
of lieutenant colonel, though he was disappointed

129
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:47,399
that as a colonial officer his salary was
much lower than those of regular officers

130
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:50,680
in the British army who had royal commissions.

131
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:56,600
In early April, Washington set out with 160
men into the wilderness, only to learn that

132
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:02,670
a force of 1,000 Frenchmen had captured the
fort the British were building at the Forks

133
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:08,210
and renamed it Fort Duquesne after the Governor
General of French Canada.

134
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:13,589
Washington and his Native American allies
called for reinforcements and made camp.

135
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:19,820
On the 28th of May 1754, Washington and his
company found a small group of French soldiers

136
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,570
encamped in a secluded position.

137
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:27,139
Believing them to be up to no good, Washington’s
men surrounded them and a quick firefight

138
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:29,709
resulted in a French surrender.

139
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:34,320
During the skirmish a French officer delivering
a diplomatic message asking the British to

140
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,510
evacuate the Ohio County was supposedly brutally
killed by one of Washington’s Native American

141
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,630
allies.

142
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:46,870
The act sparked an international incident
and while Washington was applauded in the

143
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:51,930
colonies for being a hero, the authorities
in London considered his behaviour reckless

144
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:57,740
and further evidence that colonial soldiers
could not be trusted.

145
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:02,860
Anticipating a French response, Washington
hastily constructed a wooden fort named Fort

146
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,990
Necessity.

147
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:09,380
During these preparations his commanding officer
had died after falling off his horse, and

148
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:13,510
Washington took command of the Virginia Regiment
as colonel.

149
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:19,010
When he disregarded his Native American allies’
advice to withdraw on account of the inadequate

150
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:24,860
defences provided by the fort, they deserted
him and left the British to fight alone.

151
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:30,060
When the French and their Native American
allies attacked on the 3rd of July, Washington

152
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:35,710
put up a brave fight but lost a third of his
men and was forced to surrender.

153
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:42,170
It was a humiliating defeat and he had made
many mistakes owing to his lack of experience,

154
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:47,959
but he learned from it the effectiveness of
the enemy’s mobile tactics and the futility

155
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:50,140
of defending poor positions.

156
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:55,589
The defeat could have ended Washington’s
military career before it started, but instead

157
00:12:55,589 --> 00:13:01,949
after a few weeks had passed, he and his men
were praised for their brave last stand against

158
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,139
the odds.

159
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:08,089
While the Virginia Regiment was disbanded,
leaving Washington without a command, his

160
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:14,839
personal fortunes improved when his late brother
Lawrence’s daughter died at the end of December.

161
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:20,389
As Ann had already remarried, Washington agreed
to lease the estate of Mount Vernon from his

162
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:25,070
sister-in-law, and made it his main residence.

163
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:31,019
Not long after he moved into Mount Vernon,
Washington received news in February 1755

164
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:37,440
that General Edward Braddock had landed with
two regiments of reinforcements from Britain.

165
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,389
Washington rushed to offer his services and
Braddock was happy to have him as aide-de-camp.

166
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:47,959
Leaving his younger brother Jack in charge
of Mount Vernon, Washington joined Braddock

167
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:53,240
in June and the army made its slow progress
towards Fort Duquesne.

168
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,330
Although personally warm towards Washington,
Braddock held the same disdain for colonial

169
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:03,930
soldiers as many of his fellow officers in
the regular army, and refused to heed his

170
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:09,730
aide-de-camp’s advice to travel lightly,
before eventually giving in to the situation

171
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:12,810
to pick up the glacial pace of the advance.

172
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:18,490
On the 9th of July Braddock approached Fort
Duquesne with more than two thousand men and

173
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,800
divided his army into three columns to attack.

174
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:27,880
The British were surprised by the ferocious
defence of 900 French and Native Americans

175
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,420
whose tactics once again proved superior.

176
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:36,339
Washington bravely carried out Braddock’s
orders to rally the troops, exposing himself

177
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:40,550
to great danger with two horses shot from
underneath him.

178
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:45,589
This was not enough to bring victory, and
Braddock himself was mortally wounded.

179
00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:51,010
Following Braddock’s death, the Virginia
Regiment was reformed and Washington was appointed

180
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:55,250
commander of all of Virginia’s forces.

181
00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:00,650
Despite these rapid promotions, Washington
remained unhappy about not receiving a royal

182
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,650
commission.

183
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:06,130
He resented London’s strategy to pursue
active operations in Canada while remaining

184
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:11,589
on the defensive on the frontiers of Virginia,
leaving him nothing to do but to train and

185
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:13,010
drill his men.

186
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:18,899
He was dismayed by the state of the militiamen
under his responsibility, many of whom deserted

187
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:19,940
en masse.

188
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:25,899
In late 1757, he was struck down by a grave
illness that prompted him to return to Mount

189
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:27,110
Vernon.

190
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:32,459
During this time he would begin to make changes
to the estate and create a house fit for an

191
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:34,390
English country gentleman.

192
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:41,440
In early 1758, after a brief courtship, he
was engaged to Martha Dandridge Custis, a

193
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,510
wealthy 26-year-old widow whose husband had
died the previous summer leaving her with

194
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,840
two young children.

195
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:54,120
A warm and sociable woman, Martha was the
polar opposite of her mother-in-law Mary,

196
00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:00,160
and proved a steadfast support in her husband’s
life and career, capable not only of carrying

197
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,899
out the domestic duties of a housewife but
also of running the Mount Vernon estate in

198
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:08,959
her husband’s absence.

199
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:15,130
In July 1758 Washington returned to action
as the British made a further attempt to seize

200
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:20,560
Fort Duquesne and avenge the loss of Braddock,
this time serving under the Scottish General

201
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,690
John Forbes.

202
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:27,300
In the meantime, he entered political office
for the first time by handsomely winning election

203
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:33,319
to the Virginia House of Burgesses representing
Frederick County, a reflection of his reputation

204
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:35,290
as a war hero.

205
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:39,940
Despite some disagreements with his superior
and a devastating friendly fire incident which

206
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:46,690
claimed the lives of more than twenty of his
men, Washington led 2,500 men and successfully

207
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:50,980
recaptured Fort Duquesne in November 1758.

208
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:56,399
Instead of the ferocious defence he had met
on previous occasions, he encountered no resistance

209
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,870
at all, as the French chose to abandon and
destroy the fort after falling out with their

210
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,770
Native American allies.

211
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:10,049
The British rebuilt it and named it Fort Pitt,
after war minister William Pitt, while the

212
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:16,870
city that was built around it would take the
name of Pittsburgh, in the state of Pennsylvania.

213
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:21,740
The action would be Washington’s last in
the French and Indian War, better known as

214
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:27,559
the Seven Years War in Europe, where the fighting
between Britain and France, supported by their

215
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:31,799
respective allies, would last until 1763.

216
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:37,730
Washington returned to Mount Vernon, and married
Martha on the 6th of January 1759, making

217
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,700
him one of Virginia’s richest landowners.

218
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:45,340
In their efforts to emulate the upper class
in England, importing the latest fashions

219
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:50,680
from London, Washington became increasingly
indebted to his London agents and resented

220
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,090
their power over the colonial planters.

221
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:58,330
At the same time he carried out his civic
duties in the House of Burgesses, serving

222
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:03,559
on committees related to military matters
and limiting any speeches to the most important

223
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:06,120
points of the debate.

224
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,860
For the next two decades of his life, Washington
would devote his energies to his plantation,

225
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,470
in particular to growing tobacco.

226
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:19,620
This proved a poor economic decision, and
one Washington would later regret, as the

227
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:25,070
quality of the tobacco crop was highly dependent
on weather conditions, while international

228
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,390
market prices were volatile.

229
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:32,210
These factors contributed to Washington’s
struggles repaying his debts to his creditors

230
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,559
in London.

231
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:38,850
Another key aspect of tobacco farming was
its labour intensiveness and dependence on

232
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:39,850
slavery.

233
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:43,289
During his life, Washington owned over 600
slaves.

234
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:48,450
He and his fellow planters treated slaves
as any other type of property to be bought

235
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:55,340
and sold, although over time he grew to despise
the practice and treated his slaves more humanely

236
00:18:55,340 --> 00:19:00,559
than most of his peers, looking after their
health and eventually refusing to sell any

237
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,790
of his slaves in order to keep families together.

238
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:12,100
The French and Indian War ended in 1763 in
a decisive victory for the British in North

239
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,100
America.

240
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,860
France had lost Canada to Britain and Louisiana
to Spain.

241
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:21,520
The cost to the British Treasury had been
enormous, and half the national budget went

242
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,650
on interest repayments on government debt.

243
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:29,450
In an effort to fill the hole in government
coffers, Parliament attempted to impose taxes

244
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:35,210
and other economic costs onto the North American
colonies, preventing the existing colonies

245
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,610
from further westward expansion.

246
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:42,700
As a soldier, Washington had resented the
superior attitude of the British authorities

247
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,559
and their refusal to give him a royal commission.

248
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:51,200
As a businessman, Washington now had cause
to consider the decisions of the British authorities

249
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,520
to be detrimental to his economic interests.

250
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:01,520
The most infamous piece of legislation passed
by Parliament was the Stamp Act of 1765, which

251
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:09,100
imposed a tax on all printed material, including
legal documents, newspapers, and playing cards.

252
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,560
Washington may not have been the most radical
of the voices protesting against the Stamp

253
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:19,490
Act on the political stage, but he considered
the tax unconstitutional and wrote to his

254
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:25,250
representatives in London that the colonies
would begin to boycott British goods in favour

255
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:30,559
of domestic substitutes, and courts would
shut down, preventing British creditors from

256
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,539
collecting their dues from their American
debtors.

257
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:39,740
At around the same time and perhaps concerned
about his dependency on British credit, Washington

258
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:46,490
decided to diversify away from tobacco, eventually
abandoning the crop altogether in favour of

259
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:50,370
wheat, corn, hemp, and dozens of other crops.

260
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:55,690
Mount Vernon also had an extensive fishing
enterprise from the plentiful stocks on the

261
00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:01,920
Potomac, initially for consumption within
the house and later salted and cured for export

262
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,650
to international markets.

263
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:10,150
The diversification away from the labour-intensive
tobacco crop encouraged Washington to train

264
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:18,279
his surplus slaves in a number of crafts such
as carpentry, bricklaying, smithing, and baking.

265
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:24,040
Although Parliament repealed the Stamp Act
in 1766, it continued to assert the right

266
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:30,210
to taxation in the colonies, prompting sustained
opposition which spread throughout the Thirteen

267
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,210
Colonies.

268
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:37,030
In 1767 the Townshend Acts, named after the
British Chancellor of the Exchequer at the

269
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:43,160
time, levied duties on paint, lead, glass,
paper, and tea.

270
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:49,570
During the winter of 1768-69, Washington’s
attitude became more radical and he supported

271
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,809
a boycott of British goods.

272
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:56,799
While he did not rule out armed insurrection
against what he considered a sustained attack

273
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:03,500
on American liberties, he believed that non-violent
economic measures should be used first.

274
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:10,010
In April 1769 Washington took a more proactive
role in the House of Burgesses intending to

275
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:15,770
present a plan for the importation of British
goods developed alongside his friend George

276
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:18,550
Mason of Fairfax County.

277
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:23,330
The following month the assembly voted in
favour of a set of resolves which asserted

278
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:28,250
that the House of Burgesses had the sole right
to tax Virginians.

279
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:33,400
In response the royal governor, Lord Botecourt,
dissolved the body, forcing the burgesses

280
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:39,330
to reconvene in a tavern, where they debated
and adopted Washington’s proposals to boycott

281
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:43,370
the goods subject to taxation under the Townshend
Acts.

282
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:48,830
The move had some effect, prompting the new
British government under Lord North to repeal

283
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:54,540
the Townshend Acts, keeping only the levies
on tea to continue asserting Parliament’s

284
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,870
right to taxation.

285
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:02,490
The situation had temporarily been diffused,
but the remaining taxes on tea provoked the

286
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:09,510
Boston Tea Party on the 16th of December 1773,
when a group of men from the American patriot

287
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:16,020
organisation Sons of Liberty boarded a merchant
ship belonging to the East India Company and

288
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:20,549
dumped its valuable cargo of tea into Boston
Harbour.

289
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:26,059
While Washington was dismayed by the protest,
he was furious at the British response, which

290
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:32,730
involved passing a number of draconian measures
against Boston collectively known as the Intolerable

291
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:38,770
Acts, the most important of which closed the
port of Boston to trade until the East India

292
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:42,380
Company was compensated for the loss of cargo.

293
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:48,450
In the House of Burgesses, Washington supported
an initiative to show solidarity with Boston

294
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:53,840
by convening a congress of all thirteen colonies
to protect their collective rights.

295
00:23:53,840 --> 00:24:00,179
In July 1774, while chairing a meeting in
Fairfax County, which he had represented since

296
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:08,060
1765, Washington passed the Fairfax Resolves
which he had drafted alongside George Mason,

297
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:15,270
asserting that “taxation and representation
are in their nature inseparable.”

298
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:19,640
Washington thus became one of the leading
advocates of resistance against Britain, and

299
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:25,690
on the 5th of August he was elected to Virginia’s
seven-man delegation to the First Continental

300
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:30,340
Congress in Philadelphia, which would meet
the following month.

301
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:36,390
Surrounded by some of the finest orators of
the day, Washington spoke rarely but effectively,

302
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,700
bringing together different viewpoints.

303
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,591
As the delegates were increasingly convinced
that war would break out, Washington’s name

304
00:24:43,591 --> 00:24:47,830
was on many of their lips when it came to
a commander-in-chief.

305
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:52,409
The 42-year-old Washington had developed a
sense of political maturity that had been

306
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:58,770
absent in his younger days, and did not actively
lobby for the command, confident that his

307
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:01,909
reputation would be enough to secure the post.

308
00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:07,470
For the time being, the Continental Congress
was content to set up a Continental Association

309
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:13,520
to coordinate efforts among the colonies to
ban trade with Great Britain.

310
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:20,360
On the 19th of April 1775, British redcoats
and American militiamen exchanged fire at

311
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:26,110
Concord and Lexington in Massachusetts, marking
the outbreak of the American Revolutionary

312
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,470
War.

313
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:32,080
Washington had already secured election to
the Second Continental Congress, which opened

314
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,520
on the 10th of May, with the agenda firmly
focused on raising militia and volunteers

315
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,590
across the colonies.

316
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:44,240
Washington appeared in the Congress wearing
his colonel’s uniform and his expertise

317
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,779
in military affairs was in high demand among
his fellow delegates.

318
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:53,850
On the 14th of June, the Congress assumed
control of the volunteer army laying siege

319
00:25:53,850 --> 00:26:00,000
to the British forces in Boston under the
command of General Thomas Gage, thereby creating

320
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,549
the Continental Army, and Washington was appointed
“General and Commander in Chief of the army

321
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:10,779
of the United Colonies” on the 16th.

322
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:16,820
While on his way to take command of the Continentals
in Boston, Washington received news of the

323
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:22,960
Battle of Bunker Hill on the 17th of June,
where 2,000 men under General William Howe

324
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:29,770
successfully captured the American positions,
but at the cost of 1,000 casualties, demonstrating

325
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:33,980
that the Continentals were more than capable
of putting up a fight.

326
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:39,480
Upon arriving in Boston, Washington sought
to instil in his men the idea that they were

327
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,710
a national army, rather than from a collection
of states.

328
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:50,060
Upon inspecting his army, he was disappointed
to find that he only had 14,000 men fit for

329
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:55,880
duty living in poor conditions, while supplies
of gunpowder were dangerously low.

330
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:01,240
Fearing British spies, he kept quiet about
these deficiencies to all but his closest

331
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,390
confidantes.

332
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:07,280
During this period the commander-in-chief
came to be particularly close to Brigadier

333
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:13,490
General Nathaniel Greene from Rhode Island,
as well as 25-year-old artillery commander

334
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:19,020
Colonel Henry Knox, a Boston bookseller who
had learned everything about military affairs

335
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:24,210
from the books and the British officers he
talked to in his shop.

336
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:28,710
Washington struggled in his efforts to create
a professional standing army.

337
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:33,400
Recruits were authorised to serve for one
year, with the effect that no sooner had they

338
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:39,320
been trained and drilled to fight effectively,
they would melt away and return to their homes.

339
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:46,070
As he faced losing his entire army on the
1st of January 1776, Washington attempted

340
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:51,890
to persuade the men to reenlist, but fewer
than 10,000 would agree to do so by the end

341
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:53,110
of the year.

342
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:58,600
In order to bolster numbers, Washington considered
recruiting from the black population.

343
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,860
While black soldiers had fought in the ranks
of the volunteers in Massachusetts and were

344
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:08,490
considered every bit as brave as their white
counterparts, as a leading figure of Virginia’s

345
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:14,100
slaveholding class the thought of arming black
men raised the prospect of slave rebellion.

346
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:21,040
At a war council in October Washington prohibited
any black soldiers from serving in the Continental

347
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:26,860
Army, but upon hearing that Virginia’s Governor
Lord Dunmore had promised to free slaves who

348
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:32,500
were to join the British army, Washington
compromised and allowed free blacks to serve

349
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:37,100
in his ranks, who would make up around 10%
of the Continental Army.

350
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:42,140
As winter approached, Washington realised
he could not abandon his army and return to

351
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:47,640
Mount Vernon, and instead invited his wife
Martha to stay with him.

352
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:53,250
Martha Washington would spend half the war
with her husband on campaign, serving as a

353
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:59,760
trusted confidante for his concerns and anxieties
about his army and the war.

354
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:05,240
The condition Washington’s men found themselves
in during the first winter of the war caused

355
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:10,919
morale to plummet, leading the men to question
if their cause could ever succeed.

356
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:15,630
The politicians in Philadelphia were still
split on whether to declare independence,

357
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:21,560
and some still believed in petitioning King
George III and reconciling with Britain.

358
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:28,320
The publication of Thomas Paine’s pamphlet
Common Sense in January 1776 highlighted the

359
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,650
tyrannical power of monarchy and galvanised
the movement for independence.

360
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:39,330
Spirits further increased on the 17th of January,
when Henry Knox arrived after accomplishing

361
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:45,860
the incredible logistical feat of hauling
almost sixty pieces of cannon from Fort Ticonderoga

362
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:52,520
in New York near the Canadian border across
the December snows to Washington’s camp.

363
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:57,710
Although Washington still lacked the powder
for a full assault on Boston, he successfully

364
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:03,010
manoeuvred the cannon onto the Dorchester
Heights overlooking the city during the course

365
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:10,510
of a single night on the 4th of March, leaving
the British with no choice but to evacuate.

366
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:15,471
Having captured Boston without losing a single
man, Washington hurried to New York, believing

367
00:30:15,471 --> 00:30:18,890
that General Howe would attempt to take the
city.

368
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:23,041
Although the city’s geography made it difficult
to defend from the British army, and there

369
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:28,450
was a large population of Loyalists sympathising
with the British, Washington recognised the

370
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:33,679
political and commercial importance to the
Continental cause and felt compelled to make

371
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,780
a stand despite being significantly outnumbered.

372
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:42,419
Meanwhile, the drumbeat for independence was
sounding ever louder and the Declaration of

373
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:47,049
Independence drafted by Thomas Jefferson,
Washington’s colleague in the Virginia House

374
00:30:47,049 --> 00:30:54,360
of Burgesses, was adopted by Congress on the
4th of July 1776 and was received with wild

375
00:30:54,360 --> 00:31:00,539
enthusiasm by the Continental army when Washington
read the declaration to them on the 8th.

376
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:05,840
The enthusiasm was premature, as the British
army and navy, commanded by brothers William

377
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:13,659
and Richard Howe, soon descended on New York
at the head of 32,000 men and seventy warships,

378
00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:17,700
keen to defeat the rebellion once and for
all.

379
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:25,070
By mid-August Washington had 23,000 men under
his command, but most were inexperienced recruits.

380
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:30,330
Meanwhile, when the British landed two thirds
of their force at Long Island, Washington

381
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:36,120
misread it as a diversion and only sent 6,000
men to defend the Brooklyn Heights to the

382
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,799
west of the island, keeping most of his men
in Manhattan.

383
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:46,049
On the 26th the Continentals were surrounded
by the British, with 300 killed and 1,000

384
00:31:46,049 --> 00:31:51,580
captured, but on the night of the 29th of
August Washington took advantage of Howe’s

385
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:57,250
reluctance to stage a full pursuit by evacuating
all the men from Long Island to Manhattan.

386
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:03,299
The commander himself was on the last boat
across the East River, shrouded from the British

387
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:04,660
by thick fog.

388
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:08,940
A few days later, Washington withdrew from
the city to the north.

389
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:14,200
The Continentals had built Fort Washington
and Fort Lee overlooking the Hudson River

390
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:19,559
but these were taken by the British in November,
forcing the Continentals to flee across to

391
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:20,929
New Jersey.

392
00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:26,640
These setbacks also called into question Washington’s
command abilities, and his subordinate General

393
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,159
Charles Lee schemed to replace him.

394
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:35,299
Upon discovering the plot Washington said
nothing to Lee, who received his comeuppance

395
00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:39,590
in mid-December when he was captured by the
British.

396
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:46,200
Washington’s Continental Army was a bedraggled
group of fewer than 4,000 men when it crossed

397
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:52,920
the Delaware River to Pennsylvania, while
Howe’s army was in striking range of Philadelphia,

398
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,919
forcing the Continental Congress to evacuate
to Baltimore.

399
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:01,070
With little to lose and with a few thousand
extra reinforcements under General Horatio

400
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:07,139
Gates, Washington planned a daring operation
back across the Delaware to surprise three

401
00:33:07,139 --> 00:33:12,360
regiments of Hessian mercenaries stationed
in Trenton, New Jersey.

402
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,779
Washington planned to cross the river on the
night of Christmas Day in order to surprise

403
00:33:16,779 --> 00:33:20,510
the enemy, whom he expected to be drunk at
the time.

404
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:26,779
Despite a fierce snowstorm which meant his
main column of 2,400 men only got to the other

405
00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:33,470
side of the river by four in the morning on
the 26th, Washington pressed on to Trenton.

406
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:38,309
Although the Hessians were sober, they failed
to believe that Washington would attempt such

407
00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:41,639
a daring operation in such foul weather.

408
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:47,260
The element of surprise and the effectiveness
of Henry Knox’s artillery, combined with

409
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:52,770
Washington’s effective use of terrain to
beat back a counterattack, obliged the Hessians

410
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:54,110
to surrender.

411
00:33:54,110 --> 00:34:00,760
The Continentals killed and wounded 100 Hessians
and captured 900 more, all for the loss of

412
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,690
fewer than 10 men.

413
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:08,190
While Washington is usually considered a defensive
general who avoided battle with the odds against

414
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:14,790
him, he was capable of some of the most daring
attacks in the history of warfare.

415
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:20,470
The success at Trenton was followed up by
a similarly lopsided victory at Princeton

416
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:25,970
a few days later, enabling Washington’s
men to push forward and expel the British

417
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:28,360
almost completely from New Jersey.

418
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:34,300
The victories provided a boost to morale and
allowed Congress to move back to Philadelphia,

419
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:40,000
but with only a few thousand men Washington
was obliged to remain on the defensive, launching

420
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,149
frequent raids into enemy territory.

421
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:50,940
In March 1777 the 22-year-old artillery captain
Alexander Hamilton joined Washington’s staff

422
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,629
as aide-de-camp.

423
00:34:52,629 --> 00:34:58,349
The talented Hamilton was able to handle much
of the commander-in-chief’s correspondence

424
00:34:58,349 --> 00:35:00,300
and would later become his chief aide.

425
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:06,451
At the end of July Washington welcomed to
his side the Marquis de Lafayette, a 20-year-old

426
00:35:06,451 --> 00:35:11,790
French aristocrat who shared in the political
ideals of the American Revolution and defied

427
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:17,119
a royal order to travel to America and volunteer
his service to the cause.

428
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:22,320
With Lafayette at his side, Washington and
Congress hoped that France would be persuaded

429
00:35:22,320 --> 00:37:05,760
to join an alliance with the nascent United
States.

430
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:12,290
During the first half of 1777, Washington
remained on the defensive and awaited Howe’s

431
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:13,290
movements.

432
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:18,240
By the end of August, the British commander
landed on the Chesapeake Bay and marched on

433
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,470
Philadelphia.

434
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:24,920
Keen not to lose the capital without a fight,
Washington hurried to cut him off and deployed

435
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:30,880
his army amongst the ravines of Brandywine
Creek on the southwestern approaches of the

436
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,730
city, anticipating a decisive battle.

437
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:40,440
On the 11th of September, Howe launched his
attack, sending 5,000 Hessians to attack Washington’s

438
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:47,050
main defensive position in a frontal assault,
while he led a force of more than 8,000 men

439
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:54,480
on a long flanking manoeuvre, aiming to cross
the Brandywine at a couple of undefended fords.

440
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,569
While the Continentals held firm against the
frontal assault, by midday Washington wondered

441
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:05,490
about the whereabouts of the main enemy force,
and soon began to receive reports of an enemy

442
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,040
flanking manoeuvre.

443
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:12,440
The American commander realised that he had
been outwitted and galloped to the sector

444
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:18,609
in question to find two brigades of redcoats,
not realising that Howe’s entire force was

445
00:38:18,609 --> 00:38:19,800
on its way.

446
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:25,220
By four in the afternoon, three columns of
British troops were thrown into the attack,

447
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,130
routing the Continentals.

448
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:33,349
At the end of the battle the Continentals
sustained more than 1,000 casualties, including

449
00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:38,870
400 captured, while British casualties were
half the number.

450
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:44,820
The defeat at Brandywine resulted in the British
occupation of Philadelphia, forcing Congress

451
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:48,460
to evacuate again, this time to Trenton.

452
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:53,390
Although the Continentals had fought bravely
at Brandywine, once again Washington’s failure

453
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:59,089
to prepare adequately and his inability to
respond quickly when the battle did not unfold

454
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:03,760
as planned resulted in catastrophe for the
American cause.

455
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:09,290
The American commander was not disheartened,
and on the 3rd of October less than a month

456
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:15,980
after Brandywine, Washington planned a daring
night attack on Howe’s camp at Germantown,

457
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:19,869
hoping to repeat his heroics at Trenton the
previous winter.

458
00:39:19,869 --> 00:39:24,839
However, this time round Washington’s plans
unravelled in the middle of the night and

459
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:29,770
he was forced to abandon the attack after
sustaining twice as many casualties as the

460
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:31,050
British once again.

461
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:36,130
He tried his best to make light of the defeat
in reports to Congress, and his audacious

462
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:41,390
attack demonstrated to the British that there
was still a lot of fight left in the battered

463
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:44,849
and bruised Continental Army.

464
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:49,790
While Washington’s main army had suffered
a series of setbacks against General Howe,

465
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:55,690
on the 17th of October General Horatio Gates
had defeated and captured a British army of

466
00:39:55,690 --> 00:40:02,079
5,000 men under General John Burgoyne at Saratoga
in New York, which had been attempting to

467
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,490
march south to join Howe.

468
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:09,589
While Washington welcomed the news of Gates’
stunning victory, he felt threatened by a

469
00:40:09,589 --> 00:40:14,660
subordinate who had previously been a critic,
and whom he believed was seeking the supreme

470
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,700
command for himself.

471
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:21,610
These fears were confirmed when Gates was
named as the President of the Congressional

472
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:27,200
Board of War, giving him supervisory powers
over Washington and his army.

473
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:32,790
The Board of War also appointed General Thomas
Conway as inspector general, with extensive

474
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:38,420
powers over training and discipline which
bypassed Washington, promoting him to major

475
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,300
general in the process.

476
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:45,579
When Conway arrived at Washington’s camp
at Valley Forge to announce his appointment,

477
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:51,400
the commander was incensed and informed Conway
that his generals would not recognise his

478
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,640
authority, obliging Congress to send Conway
elsewhere.

479
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:01,180
Washington had stood firm, retained his command,
and increased his authority.

480
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:08,350
Washington’s quarters for the winter of
1777-78 at Valley Forge, twenty miles to the

481
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:12,240
northwest of Philadelphia, has entered into
American legend.

482
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:18,060
For yet another winter the Continental Army
was in a desperate state and risked falling

483
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:23,460
apart, with thousands of men sick, hungry,
cold, and demoralised.

484
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:28,970
Washington’s efforts to beg Congress for
supplies came to nothing, and he came to realise

485
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:34,849
that the existing constitution, the Articles
of Confederation, which left most political

486
00:41:34,849 --> 00:41:40,339
power with individual states, gave Congress
little power and undermined his efforts to

487
00:41:40,339 --> 00:41:42,160
create a national army.

488
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:47,880
Yet Washington’s presence at the camp helped
to keep his men together in these trying times

489
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:52,930
when other armies may have melted away, while
Martha Washington’s care and attention for

490
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:57,589
the men won her respect and affection throughout
the ranks.

491
00:41:57,589 --> 00:42:02,920
Washington was also helped by the arrival
of Friedrich von Steuben, a Prussian officer

492
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:07,369
who had served in Frederick the Great’s
armies during the Seven Years War.

493
00:42:07,369 --> 00:42:13,319
The Prussian army was considered the best
in Europe, famous for its discipline and order,

494
00:42:13,319 --> 00:42:16,830
attributes which the Continentals sorely lacked.

495
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:21,680
Within a matter of weeks, Steuben drilled
the army in line and column formations and

496
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:27,420
associated manoeuvres, and also began working
on a drill manual which would remain in use

497
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,950
by the United States army for almost a century.

498
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:38,020
By the beginning of March, Washington had
12,000 men at his disposal ready for action.

499
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:43,470
A far more significant boost to the American
war effort came in the form of an alliance

500
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:48,550
with France, signed in Paris on the 6th of
February 1778.

501
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:53,210
The alliance changed the strategic picture
of the war, forcing the British troops under

502
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:58,490
their new commander Sir Henry Clinton, to
withdraw from Philadelphia to New York and

503
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:02,920
detach 8,000 men to defend the West Indies
from the French.

504
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:08,260
While Clinton’s men were on the retreat,
Washington ordered General Charles Lee, recently

505
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:14,040
released in a prisoner exchange to take up
his previous role as second-in-command, to

506
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:19,390
lead a vanguard of 5,000 men against the British
at Monmouth Court House.

507
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:25,079
Lee, who had advised against the operation,
launched a half-hearted attack that was easily

508
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:30,980
repulsed by the British, sending the Continentals
reeling and inviting a counterattack.

509
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:37,150
A furious Washington rallied his reserve of
6,000 men and managed to turn the tide of

510
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:40,680
the battle during two hours of fierce fighting.

511
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:46,190
Washington decided against sending his exhausted
army to pursue the British, who managed to

512
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:49,060
slip away to safety in the middle of the night.

513
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:54,230
In the weeks following the battle, General
Lee was court-martialled and found guilty,

514
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:58,450
and Washington was happy to see the back of
him.

515
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:03,329
For the next three years, the British forces
turned their attention to the south.

516
00:44:03,329 --> 00:44:08,630
During this period Washington would not fight
a major battle, though he was by no means

517
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:09,710
inactive.

518
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:16,640
In the summer of 1778 the French navy sailed
up the Chesapeake to join Washington, though

519
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:22,160
the cooperation between the subjects of an
absolute monarchy and the citizens of a revolutionary

520
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:28,970
republic was far from seamless, as the Americans
realised that the French were motivated foremost

521
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:35,329
by animosity against the British, rather than
support for the American cause, and once again

522
00:44:35,329 --> 00:44:40,080
Washington found himself interacting with
European military officers who looked down

523
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,420
on Americans and rarely kept him updated on
their whereabouts.

524
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:49,770
The following summer, Washington managed to
stop Clinton from controlling the Hudson River

525
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:54,990
and cutting off New England from the rest
of the United States, but this period otherwise

526
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:57,430
proved uneventful.

527
00:44:57,430 --> 00:45:03,700
By 1780, Washington’s army was low on money
and supplies, and military success seemed

528
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,849
impossible without the assistance of the French.

529
00:45:06,849 --> 00:45:13,099
Lafayette had been in France since the beginning
of 1779 and lobbied for greater French assistance

530
00:45:13,099 --> 00:45:14,930
to the American cause.

531
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:21,670
King Louis XVI answered the call by sending
an expeditionary force of 6,000 men to America

532
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:26,869
under the command of the Comte de Rochambeau
in conjunction with the fleet commanded by

533
00:45:26,869 --> 00:45:32,609
the Chevalier de Ternay, who landed in Newport,
Rhode Island on the 10th of July 1780.

534
00:45:32,609 --> 00:45:38,021
Meanwhile, the Continentals had suffered a
series of setbacks in the south, beginning

535
00:45:38,021 --> 00:45:44,099
with the loss of the port of Charleston in
South Carolina in May, and followed by Horatio

536
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:50,020
Gates’ defeat to General Charles Cornwallis
at the Battle of Camden in South Carolina

537
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:56,200
on the 16th of August, whose dismissal by
Congress in the aftermath of the debacle removed

538
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:01,270
the final challenger to Washington’s authority
in the Continental Army.

539
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:06,950
Worse was to follow in late September, when
Washington belatedly recognised the treachery

540
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:12,880
of Benedict Arnold, the courageous Continental
Army officer who had fought with distinction

541
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:19,349
at Saratoga, but had been nursing a wounded
ego after being overlooked for promotion.

542
00:46:19,349 --> 00:46:25,339
In August, Arnold had been appointed commandant
of the vital strategic fort of West Point,

543
00:46:25,339 --> 00:46:30,970
but rather than strengthen his defences he
plotted to surrender it to the British, managing

544
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:35,500
to escape just in time when the plot was discovered.

545
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:41,960
By 1781, British successes in the south and
Arnold’s defection threatened Washington’s

546
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,849
home state of Virginia.

547
00:46:43,849 --> 00:46:49,470
Governor Thomas Jefferson, whose own home
at Monticello had been occupied by Arnold’s

548
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:53,660
men, urged Washington to lead his men south
to defend his home state.

549
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:58,770
Though the American commander was anxious
about the fate of his beloved Mount Vernon

550
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:03,760
and had sent a division under Lafayette to
confront Arnold in Virginia, Washington preferred

551
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,980
to keep his men in New York and believed the
decisive blow against the British would fall

552
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:13,680
there, though his French allies planned an
operation in the south instead.

553
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:19,190
By mid-August, Washington abandoned his designs
on New York when he received news that a French

554
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:25,790
fleet of 29 ships under the command of Admiral
de Grasse had set sail from the West Indies

555
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:32,740
and intended to land a force of 3,500 men
on the Chesapeake in early September.

556
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:37,950
Washington had also received news from Lafayette
that Cornwallis had retreated to Yorktown,

557
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:43,990
located on the eastern tip of the Virginia
peninsula and surrounded by water on three

558
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:45,110
sides.

559
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:50,160
Washington and Rochambeau hurried south in
an effort to trap Cornwallis and force him

560
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,170
to surrender.

561
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:57,900
By the beginning of September de Grasse’s
fleet had arrived on the Chesapeake as planned,

562
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:02,990
overcoming limited British resistance, leaving
Cornwallis trapped between the French ships

563
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:06,599
at sea and Lafayette’s small force on land.

564
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:12,500
By the 18th of September, Washington and Rochambeau
met with the admiral to discuss plans for

565
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,500
the siege.

566
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:18,750
De Grasse was adamant that he would have to
return to the West Indies no later than the

567
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:23,040
1st of November, allowing little more than
a month for the operation.

568
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:28,910
When Washington and Rochambeau began to lay
siege to Yorktown on the 28th of September,

569
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:34,240
the American commander deferred to his French
counterpart, who was more experienced in siege

570
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,240
tactics.

571
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:42,300
Cornwallis’s army of 9,000 men was significantly
outnumbered by the 19,000 French and Americans

572
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:47,710
besieging Yorktown, and the British general
desperately pleaded for additional reinforcements

573
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:49,650
from General Clinton.

574
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:54,290
After the French engineers built two lines
of trenches, allowing allied artillery to

575
00:48:54,290 --> 00:49:00,910
rain down cannonballs into Yorktown, on the
14th the allies successfully captured two

576
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:06,960
British redoubts in front of the town, and
by the 16th they were so close to the British

577
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:12,900
lines that Cornwallis attempted a last-ditch
evacuation across the York River which was

578
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,910
scuppered by poor weather.

579
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:20,920
On the morning of the 17th of October 1783,
Cornwallis sent Washington a message to discuss

580
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:25,520
the terms of surrender, which were signed
on the 19th.

581
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:31,760
Cornwallis’s surrender at Yorktown did not
end the war, but it persuaded the authorities

582
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:38,650
in London that it was no longer worth sustaining
the costly effort to retain the American colonies.

583
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:44,559
Upon hearing of the news of Yorktown, Lord
North is said to have exclaimed “Oh God!

584
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:50,609
It’s all over!”, and his government duly
collapsed in early 1782.

585
00:49:50,609 --> 00:49:56,869
Henry Clinton was replaced as commander-in-chief
by Sir Guy Carleton, whose role was largely

586
00:49:56,869 --> 00:50:02,549
reduced to organising the evacuation of British
assets from their former colonies.

587
00:50:02,549 --> 00:50:08,109
Washington regarded Carleton’s peace offers
with suspicion, and still anticipated continued

588
00:50:08,109 --> 00:50:09,109
hostilities.

589
00:50:09,109 --> 00:50:15,619
However, aside from a handful of skirmishes
in the south over the course of 1782, the

590
00:50:15,619 --> 00:50:23,280
war was over and preliminary peace terms were
signed in Paris on the 30th of November 1782,

591
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:29,240
an extraordinarily generous settlement recognising
the independence of the United States of America,

592
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:34,069
with borders stretching north to the Great
Lakes and west to the Mississippi, setting

593
00:50:34,069 --> 00:50:40,790
the stage for a final peace ratified in September
1783.

594
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:47,369
Although he had been the most powerful individual
in the United States with an army at his disposal,

595
00:50:47,369 --> 00:50:52,740
Washington chose to return to life as a private
citizen at Mount Vernon and relinquished his

596
00:50:52,740 --> 00:51:00,610
commission on the 23rd of December 1783, following
the example of Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus,

597
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:06,880
the 5th century BC Roman general famed for
relinquishing his powers as dictator after

598
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,920
being summoned to defeat Rome’s enemies.

599
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,930
Upon returning to Mount Vernon, Washington
set out to give his estate a new lease of

600
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:18,930
life after the neglect it had suffered during
the war.

601
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:24,490
During this period Washington was courted
by anti-slavery campaigners, including Lafayette,

602
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:30,930
who proposed an experiment to educate and
free slaves who would become tenant farmers.

603
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:37,260
Washington had always believed slavery was
an economically inefficient institution, and

604
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:42,400
after the war he became morally opposed to
slavery, but he could not bear overhauling

605
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:47,650
the entire economic system on which his livelihood
as a planter depended.

606
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:53,059
Like many of his fellow planters, Washington
naively believed that the institution of slavery

607
00:51:53,059 --> 00:51:57,059
would die out naturally in the future.

608
00:51:57,059 --> 00:52:02,829
Despite his desire to leave public life, Washington’s
reputation meant that he could not remain

609
00:52:02,829 --> 00:52:05,110
in obscurity for long.

610
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:10,400
Throughout the war he had longed for a stronger
central government that could compel the states

611
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:15,180
to supply his army, and he had not departed
from this belief.

612
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:20,369
Washington therefore welcomed an initiative
to revise the Articles of Confederation led

613
00:52:20,369 --> 00:52:26,299
by his former aide Alexander Hamilton and
the Virginian politician James Madison and

614
00:52:26,299 --> 00:52:31,930
was invited by the latter to head a delegation
from Virginia to a constitutional convention

615
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:36,600
in Philadelphia scheduled for May 1787.

616
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:41,920
After months of hesitation, Washington answered
the call of duty and was duly elected President

617
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,859
of the Constitutional Convention on the 25th
of May.

618
00:52:45,859 --> 00:52:51,450
The role was a perfect fit for the non-partisan
Washington, who intervened occasionally to

619
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:54,559
broker agreement between different points
of view.

620
00:52:54,559 --> 00:53:00,329
The convention was dominated by two major
questions, both relating to representation.

621
00:53:00,329 --> 00:53:06,180
The more populous states such as Virginia
wanted an assembly with seats allocated according

622
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:11,130
to population, while smaller states desired
equal representation.

623
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:17,130
In mid-July a compromise was reached whereby
all states would be represented equally with

624
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:22,109
two members in the Senate, while the seats
of the House of Representatives would be based

625
00:53:22,109 --> 00:53:23,520
on population.

626
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:29,360
The second compromise was over slavery – while
slaves would not have any political rights,

627
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:34,380
slaveholding states could count three-fifths
of the slave population in determining their

628
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:36,610
representation in Congress.

629
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:42,319
The convention also created an independent
executive branch from Congress, and it was

630
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:47,720
widely assumed that Washington would become
the first President.

631
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:53,890
The proceedings in Philadelphia were concluded
on the 17th of September 1787, but it was

632
00:53:53,890 --> 00:54:00,690
not until July 1788 when the Constitution
was ratified, with Washington’s native Virginia

633
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:03,500
being one of the last to do so.

634
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:08,230
Washington hesitated to declare his candidacy
for the presidency, responding to fears that

635
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:14,300
he might have royal ambitions, though his
reputation as the American Cincinnatus and

636
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:19,690
his childless status helped to calm fears
of a hereditary monarchy and led admirers

637
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:22,660
to call him ‘Father of the Country.’

638
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:28,910
Thus, when the presidential election was held
in early 1789, Washington was unanimously

639
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:34,550
elected President while John Adams of Massachusetts
was elected Vice President.

640
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:39,569
After the election was certified on the 6th
of April, Washington travelled to New York,

641
00:54:39,569 --> 00:54:44,940
the temporary home of the federal government,
and was inaugurated as President on the 30th

642
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:48,530
of April 1789.

643
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:52,680
When Washington took office as President,
the institutions of the federal government

644
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:54,430
were still being set up.

645
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:59,460
The Constitution had left the duties of the
President deliberately vague and it was up

646
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:03,970
to Congress and Washington to delineate their
respective powers.

647
00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:09,470
Washington’s four-man cabinet was assembled
by the spring of 1790, including his former

648
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:12,970
subordinates in the army and his fellow Virginians.

649
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:18,880
Alexander Hamilton was appointed Secretary
of the Treasury, Henry Knox Secretary of War,

650
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:25,730
Thomas Jefferson Secretary of State, and Jefferson’s
cousin Edmund Randolph as Attorney General.

651
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:30,789
The Constitution did not provide for a cabinet
in the British sense, and Washington typically

652
00:55:30,789 --> 00:55:34,069
worked directly with his cabinet secretaries.

653
00:55:34,069 --> 00:55:39,180
In the early stages of his presidency, Washington
also relied heavily on the advice of James

654
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:44,940
Madison, the Father of the Constitution who
served as a congressman representing Virginia

655
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:46,680
in the House of Representatives.

656
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:52,680
Washington’s Vice President, John Adams,
played a minor role in his administration,

657
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:57,520
and took his duties as President of the Senate
more seriously.

658
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:02,270
Among Washington’s cabinet secretaries,
the most brilliant was Alexander Hamilton,

659
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:07,309
who laboured hard to strengthen the power
of the federal government, carrying out his

660
00:56:07,309 --> 00:56:13,450
duties as tirelessly as he had done as Washington’s
chief aide during the revolutionary war.

661
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:18,079
Unlike the President, Hamilton had a grand
vision for the architecture of the federal

662
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:24,060
government and had also developed an expertise
in financial matters that Washington could

663
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:29,230
not match, effectively making him into an
unofficial prime minister.

664
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:35,680
Despite being an admirer of Washington, Jefferson
viewed Hamilton’s designs with suspicion,

665
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:41,299
believing that they would lead to a despotic
presidency, and criticised the President privately

666
00:56:41,299 --> 00:56:43,710
for going along with such ideas.

667
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:49,539
The Hamilton and Jefferson rivalry reflected
the intellectual and ideological debate over

668
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:54,580
the future direction of the American government,
and while Washington allowed free debate among

669
00:56:54,580 --> 00:57:01,339
his cabinet members, he was no impartial observer
and played an active role in decision-making,

670
00:57:01,339 --> 00:57:05,950
controlling the agenda and requesting papers
from his cabinet secretaries for his personal

671
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:07,670
approval each day.

672
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:12,740
Washington’s leadership style was slow and
deliberative, and he consulted widely before

673
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:19,589
making decisions, a privilege that he did
not have while a general in the heat of battle.

674
00:57:19,589 --> 00:57:24,970
The debate over Hamilton’s economic agenda
dominated Washington’s presidency.

675
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:32,260
In January 1790 Hamilton delivered his Report
on the Public Credit, which proposed the creation

676
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:38,200
of a national debt to be paid over time and
financed by new taxes.

677
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:44,369
Additionally, Hamilton proposed that the federal
government should assume state debts, in effect

678
00:57:44,369 --> 00:57:50,010
transferring the loyalty of debtholders from
the states to the national government.

679
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:54,430
Washington shared Hamilton’s belief in a
powerful national government which could raise

680
00:57:54,430 --> 00:58:00,490
funds to meet its financial obligations, and
was happy to let his Treasury Secretary work

681
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:01,930
out the details.

682
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:07,060
Any talk of taxation brought up memories of
British colonial rule, prompting Madison to

683
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:12,160
come out in opposition and break his alliance
with Hamilton and Washington, withholding

684
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,859
congressional support for the proposals.

685
00:58:14,859 --> 00:58:19,839
The President was disappointed by the loss
of a close ally, as well as the beginnings

686
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:24,960
of the split between the northern and southern
states which would continue to define American

687
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,079
politics until the present day.

688
00:58:27,079 --> 00:58:32,950
Washington would also prove a supporter of
Hamilton’s proposals for a national bank,

689
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:37,570
despite the arguments from Jefferson and his
fellow Virginians that such a move would be

690
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:40,309
unconstitutional.

691
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:45,260
The debate over the public debt coincided
with disagreements about the location of the

692
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:48,240
permanent capital of the United States.

693
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:52,549
Many southerners hoped to bring the capital
further to the south, and Madison favoured

694
00:58:52,549 --> 00:58:57,950
a location in Virginia along the banks of
the Potomac, where both he and Washington

695
00:58:57,950 --> 00:58:59,150
had property.

696
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:04,880
Naturally, the President welcomed this prospect,
but Congress was now deadlocked on both issues.

697
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:11,730
A crucial meeting between Hamilton, Jefferson,
and Madison in June 1790 saw the three men

698
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:16,870
broker a deal whereby the Virginians agreed
to drop opposition to Hamilton’s economic

699
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:22,580
programme in return for Hamilton supporting
the proposal to move to Philadelphia as a

700
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:29,150
temporary capital for ten years while a permanent
one was being built on the Potomac.

701
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:34,510
Washington was given power to choose the site,
and duly picked a location not far from Mount

702
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:39,910
Vernon, and the commissioners he had chosen
to oversee the project later decided to name

703
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:43,420
the city Washington, in the District of Columbia.

704
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:48,500
The two debates which had threatened to dissolve
the union were therefore both resolved in

705
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,880
Washington’s favour.

706
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:55,130
The debate over the future of the union and
the powers of the federal government easily

707
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:57,849
spilled over into foreign affairs.

708
00:59:57,849 --> 01:00:02,030
Although he had fought against the British,
Washington and Hamilton realised that the

709
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:08,930
prosperity of the United States remained dependent
on trade and commerce with the former imperial

710
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:13,190
master, which recovered rapidly after the
end of the war.

711
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:18,140
Jefferson, Washington’s Secretary of State
and chief foreign policy advisor, remained

712
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:24,390
attached to France, especially after Louis
XVI’s absolute monarchy was overthrown by

713
01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:31,780
the Revolution of 1789, which Jefferson witnessed
first-hand as ambassador to France shortly

714
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:34,400
before his return to the United States.

715
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:39,420
Lafayette had emerged as one of the leaders
of the revolutionary government, inspired

716
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:44,120
by the ideas of liberty which he had fought
for in America.

717
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:49,490
Washington feared that the French Revolution
may descend into mob violence, a fear that

718
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:56,329
proved prophetic in the subsequent years when
the radical Jacobin faction took over in September

719
01:00:56,329 --> 01:01:03,839
1792 and executed King Louis and Queen Marie
Antoinette the following year, while Lafayette

720
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:06,940
was forced into exile.

721
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:13,170
Despairing in Hamilton and Jefferson’s rivalry,
whose supporters had coalesced into two parties,

722
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:19,750
the Federalists and Republicans respectively,
Washington sought to bring the two men together.

723
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:24,090
Despite his skill in finding common ground
across political divides at the Continental

724
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:30,150
Congress and in the Constitutional Convention,
the President struggled to do so in the face

725
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:35,760
of these two towering personalities, who had
taken to attacking each other by writing anonymous

726
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,670
letters in the press.

727
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:42,520
Washington intended to step down from the
presidency after one term, but was persuaded

728
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:48,200
by both men to stay on, believing that he
was the only man who could keep the country

729
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,270
together.

730
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:55,660
During the winter of 1792 he was re-elected
to a second term, while Adams remained in

731
01:01:55,660 --> 01:02:00,039
post as Vice President, seeing off a challenge
from Jefferson.

732
01:02:00,039 --> 01:02:06,410
However, the Jeffersonian Republicans had
won a clear majority in the House of Representatives,

733
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:11,460
setting the stage for strong congressional
opposition to Washington’s administration

734
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:14,180
during his second term.

735
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:19,609
Washington’s second term was dominated by
foreign policy issues arising from the war

736
01:02:19,609 --> 01:02:24,039
which had broken out between Britain and France
in 1792.

737
01:02:24,039 --> 01:02:29,800
While Jefferson argued that the United States
and France were still allies from the war,

738
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:35,330
Hamilton and Knox believed that the alliance
was null and void now that Louis XVI had been

739
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:38,089
overthrown and executed.

740
01:02:38,089 --> 01:02:42,260
Washington hoped to remain neutral between
the two warring nations, knowing that the

741
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:47,950
United States was too weak to exert much diplomatic
or military pressure.

742
01:02:47,950 --> 01:02:54,320
Following Washington’s proclamation of American
neutrality on the 22nd of April, 1793, the

743
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:59,650
French envoy Edmond-Charles Genet went to
Philadelphia in an effort to persuade the

744
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:02,760
United States to go to war against Britain.

745
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:08,170
While the Frenchman proved popular among the
American public, Washington received him coldly

746
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:11,570
as someone seeking to interfere in American
politics.

747
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:18,299
Genet made matters worse by encouraging French
privateers attacking British shipping to sail

748
01:03:18,299 --> 01:03:23,770
into American ports, and threatened to go
over Washington’s head and appeal to the

749
01:03:23,770 --> 01:03:24,930
American people.

750
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:31,500
These insults damaged the pro-French cause
and prompted the American cabinet to ask for

751
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:36,650
Genet’s recall, but upon learning that the
Jacobins were recalling their envoy and planned

752
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:42,750
to put him on trial, Washington granted him
asylum in the United States.

753
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:48,569
The conduct of the British during this period
also increased tensions with the United States.

754
01:03:48,569 --> 01:03:55,740
In the summer of 1793 the British began to
intercept neutral ships bound for French ports,

755
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:59,260
thereby confiscating the cargo of American
ships.

756
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:04,240
The British navy’s practice of impressment,
rounding up British deserters aboard American

757
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:10,040
ships to serve in the navy, frequently caught
innocent Americans in the net.

758
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:14,720
Responding to Federalist calls for a special
envoy to be sent to Britain to negotiate a

759
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:20,710
treaty of commerce and diffuse the threat
of war, Washington dispatched John Jay, an

760
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:26,220
experienced diplomat who was serving as Chief
Justice, a choice which raised questions about

761
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:31,180
the separation of powers between the judicial
and executive branches of government.

762
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:38,309
The treaty negotiated by Jay in February 1795
did not address all of the American grievances

763
01:04:38,309 --> 01:04:43,700
and tilted the economic relationship in favour
of Britain, but stopped the drift towards

764
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:44,700
war.

765
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:49,450
Washington was prepared to sign this imperfect
document but its publication in the press

766
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:52,690
provoked outrage among the Republicans.

767
01:04:52,690 --> 01:04:58,460
Jefferson had left his post of Secretary of
State in 1793 and attempted to rally House

768
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:02,260
Republicans to withhold funding to implement
the treaty.

769
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:07,390
The attempt failed narrowly, but promoted
Washington to break his ties with his erstwhile

770
01:05:07,390 --> 01:05:10,000
friend and advisor.

771
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:15,730
Washington’s support for the Jay Treaty
provoked a tide of Republican criticism, and

772
01:05:15,730 --> 01:05:20,869
the lustre of his exploits during the revolutionary
war was no longer sufficient to shore up his

773
01:05:20,869 --> 01:05:24,480
reputation in Jeffersonian circles.

774
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:28,670
Exhausted by the burdens of office and having
suffered from a series of illnesses during

775
01:05:28,670 --> 01:05:34,340
his presidency, the 64-year-old Washington
announced his desire to retire from public

776
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:37,490
life after serving out his second term.

777
01:05:37,490 --> 01:05:43,460
By doing so, he created a powerful precedent
of a two-term limit that would only be broken

778
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:44,460
once.

779
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:50,350
In his Farewell Address, drafted by Hamilton
and published in September 1796, the departing

780
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:56,690
president pleaded for national unity in the
face of domestic and international challenges.

781
01:05:56,690 --> 01:06:02,960
Washington was succeeded by John Adams on
the 4th of March 1797, but his calls for unity

782
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:08,599
went unheeded, and the factionalism between
the Federalists and Republicans would only

783
01:06:08,599 --> 01:06:11,150
become more intense.

784
01:06:11,150 --> 01:06:16,900
Washington’s retirement would prove to be
short, and when war with France appeared imminent

785
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:23,540
in 1798, Washington was named as the head
of the army, but his efforts to have Alexander

786
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:29,349
Hamilton as his second-in-command in the stead
of more senior officers such as Henry Knox

787
01:06:29,349 --> 01:06:34,400
was vigorously opposed by President Adams,
poisoning Washington’s relations with both

788
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,930
Adams and Knox.

789
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:41,779
Diplomatic overtures to France managed to
avert the tide of war and Washington returned

790
01:06:41,779 --> 01:06:43,140
to Mount Vernon.

791
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:48,220
He retained an active interest in farming
matters despite his advanced age, and on the

792
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:56,070
12th of December 1799 he spent five hours
riding around his estate encountering an unexpected

793
01:06:56,070 --> 01:06:57,070
snowstorm.

794
01:06:57,070 --> 01:07:02,940
The exposure to the elements made him ill,
and he died on the 14th of December 1799.

795
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:08,620
A few months before his death, Washington
wrote a new will which stipulated that his

796
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:15,680
property would pass onto Martha, but upon
her death the 120 slaves he left her would

797
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:16,910
be freed.

798
01:07:16,910 --> 01:07:21,789
Martha had not been consulted on the will
and was afraid that the slaves might be motivated

799
01:07:21,789 --> 01:07:27,140
to kill her, and decided to free her late
husband’s slaves on the 1st of January 1801,

800
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:33,180
a little more than a year before her own death
in May 1802.

801
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:39,430
Washington’s death was met with widespread
mourning across the United States, and he

802
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:44,289
continues to be admired as one of America’s
greatest generals and presidents.

803
01:07:44,289 --> 01:07:50,180
Over the course of his 67 years he had been
a key participant in some of the most important

804
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:52,430
events in world history.

805
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:57,270
Born into a colonial family of modest means,
Washington began his military career as a

806
01:07:57,270 --> 01:08:03,490
headstrong officer in the British colonial
army resentful of his treatment by London.

807
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:08,390
He would end it as the man who defeated one
of the most formidable European armies in

808
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:14,710
war, securing independence for a country founded
on the principles of liberty and equality.

809
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:19,449
He would then play a key role in the establishment
and consolidation of the American political

810
01:08:19,449 --> 01:08:25,290
system by presiding over the constitutional
convention and serving as the first President

811
01:08:25,290 --> 01:08:26,949
of the United States.

812
01:08:26,949 --> 01:08:32,679
Washington’s belief in a strong federal
government to ensure the security and prosperity

813
01:08:32,679 --> 01:08:38,200
of the new nation made him an opponent of
his fellow Virginian planters, but helped

814
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:45,480
to pave the way for the United States to become
the global hegemon of the 21st century.

815
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:51,279
The universal admiration for Washington may
overlook some of his deficiencies as a soldier

816
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:53,100
and politician.

817
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:58,589
Over the course of his military career, Washington
lost more battles than he won, and his mistakes

818
01:08:58,589 --> 01:09:03,720
at New York and Brandywine were responsible
for devastating defeats.

819
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:08,250
While Washington managed to keep his army
alive, he could not have dealt the victorious

820
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:13,290
blow at Yorktown without the assistance of
the French army and navy.

821
01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:19,199
As a politician, Washington lacked the intellectual
vision of the likes of Hamilton and Jefferson,

822
01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:24,609
and was naïve to believe that it was possible
to avoid the partisan divides that have defined

823
01:09:24,609 --> 01:09:27,000
American politics ever since.

824
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:32,610
On the issue of slavery, while Washington’s
attitude later in life was far more progressive

825
01:09:32,610 --> 01:09:38,049
than most of his peers, he was unwilling to
challenge the southern planters on the future

826
01:09:38,049 --> 01:09:44,060
of the institution, even after breaking with
them on Hamilton’s economic programme.

827
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:51,009
Instead, he would defer the issue to future
generations of political leaders.

828
01:09:51,009 --> 01:09:53,760
What do you think of George Washington?

829
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:59,690
Was he a great military figure whose inspirational
leadership enabled a ragtag army to defeat

830
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:05,470
the might of the British Empire, and a skilful
politician whose pragmatism held the union

831
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:09,340
together while the Constitution laid down
its roots?

832
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:15,390
Or was he a mediocre general and a politician
who was given the credit rightfully belonging

833
01:10:15,390 --> 01:10:20,450
to his subordinates and allies both in war
and politics?

834
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:26,080
Please let us know in the comment section
and in the meantime, thank you very much for

835
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:26,440
watching.
